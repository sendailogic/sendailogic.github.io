- Abstract:  Abstract: The weak Paris-Harrington principle is a weak version of the Paris-Harrington principle, which was originally used as a convenient intermediate version in showing lower bounds for the Paris-Harrington principle for pairs [1]. We compare it with Dickson's lemma, which is a combinatorial theorem originally used in algebra, in particular for showing Hilbert's basis theorem [2]. We give a construction which shows the direct, level by level, equivalence between the weak Paris-Harrington principle for pairs and the Friedman-style miniaturization of Dickson's lemma.
Our studies result in a cascade of consequences:
    - An explicit expression for weak Ramsey numbers for pairs.
    - A sharp classification of the complexity classes of weak Paris-Harrington-Ramsey numbers.
    - Bounds for weak Ramsey numbers in higher dimensions.
    - A phase transition for the weak Paris-Harrington principle which is different from that for the Paris-Harrington principle [3].
    - Level by level equivalence of Dickson's lemma and a relativized version of the weak Paris-Harrington principle.

All of these are established in RCA_0^*.
This is a joint work with Florian Pelupessy.
