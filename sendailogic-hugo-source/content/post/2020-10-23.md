Higher Order Computability

<!--more-->

- Date/Time: October 23, 2020 (Friday) / 15:00 - 16:00.

- Speaker: Hiroyuki Ikari (東北大学大学院 理学研究科)

- Venue: Room 802, Science Complex A, Tohoku University.

- Abstract:  Higher order reverse math has a strong connection with higher order computability, as the ordinary reverse math. In the former part of this talk, we'll study one of reasonable higher order computability notions, which was introduced by S. C. Kleene. That notion allows us to use some theorems similar with ones in 1st order computability theory. \
In the later part, we'll see some typical theories and models observed in higher order reverse math.
