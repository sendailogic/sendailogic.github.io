Hindman’s theorem and Gowers’ theorem in second order arithmetic

<!--more-->

- Date/Time: October 16, 2020 (Friday) / 15:00 - 16:00.

- Speaker: Yudai Suzuki (東北大学大学院 理学研究科)

- Venue: Room 802, Science Complex A, Tohoku University.

- Abstract:  Hindman's theorem is a Ramsey-type theorem which was proved by N. Hindman.
Galvin-Glazer gave a proof of it which uses an ultrafilter on \\(\mathbb{N}\\) with specific properties. In the context of reverse mathematics, Galvin-Glazer's proof was analysed by H. Towsner, and it was shown that the proof can be formalized in \\(\Pi^1_1\\)-\\(\text{TR}_0\\).\
Gowers' theorem is a generalization of Hindman's theorem which is provable in a similar way of Galvin-Glazer's proof of Hindman's theorem.
In this talk, we will compare those proofs and then consider how the proof of Gowers' theorem be formalized in second order arithmetic.
