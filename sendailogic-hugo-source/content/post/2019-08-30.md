Standard and choiceless set-theoretic geology

<!--more-->

- Date/Time: August 30, 2019 (Friday) / 13:00 - 14:00

- Speaker: Prof.  T. Usuba (Waseda Univ.)

- Venue: Rm 205, Science Complex A, Tohoku Univ.

- Abstract:  The set-theoretic geology, which was initiated by Fuchs-Hamkins-Reitz,
is a study of the global structure of all ground models of the universe.
It attempts a study of the nature of the forcing method.
In this talk, we present a framework of set-theoretic geology and basic results.
Meanwhile, the standard geology is a research on ZFC, so the axiom of choice is assumed.
However in the current set theory, the forcing method over choiceless model become a common tool.
We also present the set-theoretic geology without the axiom of choice.
