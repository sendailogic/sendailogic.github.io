Title: Standard and choiceless set-theoretic geology\
Abstract:The set-theoretic geology, which was initiated by Fuchs-Hamkins-Reitz, is a study of the global structure of all ground models of the universe. It attempts a study of the nature of the forcing method. In this talk, we present a framework of set-theoretic geology and basic results. Meanwhile, the standard geology is a research on ZFC, so the axiom of choice is assumed. However in the current set theory, the forcing method over choiceless model become a common tool. We also present the set-theoretic geology without the axiom of choice.
