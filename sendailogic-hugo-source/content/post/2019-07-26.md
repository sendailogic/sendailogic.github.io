Cichon's maximum without large cardinals

<!--more-->

- Date/Time: July 26, 2019 (Friday) / 16:00 - 17:00

- Speaker: Prof.  Diego A. Mejía (Shizuoka Univ.)

- Venue: Rm 1201, Science Complex A, Tohoku Univ.

- Abstract: Cichon's diagram is formed by cardinal characteristics of
combinatorial properties related to Lebesgue measure,
category and compactness of subsets of the irrationals.
In the 1980's decades it was proved that the diagram is complete
(in the sense that no other inequality can be proved), but
just very recently the search of models where many cardinals
of the diagram can be pairwise different has been very active.\
Jointly with Goldstern, Kellner and Shelah, we proved that
all the cardinals in the diagram can be pairwise different
(exlcuding, of course, obvious equalities). In this seminar
I will outline the proof of this result. No deep understanding of
forcing is required, instead the talked is supported on
basic knowledge about models of set theory and elementary
embeddings.
