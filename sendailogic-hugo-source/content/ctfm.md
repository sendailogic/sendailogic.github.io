## Concept
Computability Theory and Foundations of Mathematics (CTFM) aims to develop computability theory and logical foundations of Mathematics. The scope involves the topics Computability Theory, Reverse Mathematics, Nonstandard Analysis, Proof Theory, Constructive Mathematics, Theory of Randomness and Computational Complexity Theory.

CTFM series has been headed by Kazuyuki Tanaka (Tohoku University). Previous meetings were held as "Workshop on Proof Theory and Computability Theory" and have taken place in Matsushima (2008, 2009) and Inawashiro (2010).
